# Disclaimer
brsnmp comes „as is“, e.g. without support and warranty.
You can freely copy it but use it at your own risk.

# PVI
brsnmp requires PVI 4.x.
it needs a previously installed [PVI Development Setup](https://www.br-automation.com/en/downloads/#categories=Software/Automation+NET%2FPVI) to run.
Beware: if you do not own a PVI license **1TG0500.02** (+ TG Guard e.t. 0TG1000.02) PVI will run for two hours only. After this period brwatch will stop working and PVI-Manager must be stopped and restarted again.
So, do not blame brsnmp for that and contact your local B&R office to buy it.
